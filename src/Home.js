        <p>
          <b>The Weather & Recipe Finder</b> is a React-based web app that helps users stay informed about the weather while offering personalized recipe suggestions tailored to the current conditions. <br/>
          The project demonstrates the seamless integration of multiple APIs to enhance the user experience. The app fetches real-time weather updates via a Weather API, and based on the conditions, it suggests recipes through a Recipe Finder API. Axios is used for efficient data fetching, while CSS and Styled-Components give the app its clean, responsive design.<br/>
          <b>Technologies Used: React.Js, Bootstarp, Javascript, HTML, CSS, Axios, API's.</b>
